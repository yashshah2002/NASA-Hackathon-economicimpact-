COVID-19 pandemic has brought some of the drastic changes to the world and it's can still be seen in different parts of the world. We have even face shortage of some basic amities like medicines, food, public transportation. But sometimes we forget that whom does all this shortage affects the most. People with low-income, indigenous people or tribal people has faced all this shortage the most. So, we decided to make website with all the collaborative data provided on EO Dashboard by NASA, JAXA and ESA and see how to solve the above problems. The data will give us an insight on how this people suffer and will help us find a solution to that.
